# Ecology Counts! Analyzing Bias in Ecology Journal Entries

This project investigates potential bias in ecology journal entries by analyzing the frequency of published articles from various regions, ecosystems, countries, and other geographical categories. The goal is to determine whether there is a disproportionate representation in published journal articles, focusing on the geographic distribution and ecosystems where studies are conducted.

## Project Overview

The study uses contingency tables, chi-square tests, and visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs to analyze whether the distribution of published articles aligns with the expected frequency across different categories (continents, countries, regions, ecosystems). Additional square mileage data was introduced to adjust expected frequencies and assess the impact of geographic size on publication frequency.

The project was completed by **Brianna Cirillo**, **Odalys Barrientos**, and **Veronica Marquez**.

### Key Objectives:
- Evaluate whether ecology journals disproportionately represent specific regions or ecosystems.
- Use contingency tables to determine the frequency distribution of journal entries across continents, countries, regions, states, and ecosystems.
- Apply chi-square tests to test whether observed frequencies match the expected frequencies under different assumptions (e.g., equal distribution or square mileage).

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Journal articles were categorized by continent, country, region, state, and ecosystem. Data was cleaned to remove irrelevant or missing entries.
2. **Contingency Tables**: Created to show the frequency distribution of journal entries in each independent variable.
3. **Chi-Square Test**: Used to test whether the observed distribution of journal entries significantly differs from the expected distribution.
   - **Assumption 1**: Equal chance for each category (e.g., continent or ecosystem) to be represented in the published journals.
   - **Assumption 2**: Expected distribution is proportional to square mileage of each category (for geographic variables).
4. **Visualization**: Pie charts and bar graphs were used to provide a visual understanding of the observed and expected distributions.

## Key Findings

- **Continent Representation**: North America had a disproportionately high number of published articles, while continents like Australia and Africa were underrepresented.
- **Country Representation**: The United States accounted for the majority of the published studies, far surpassing other countries.
- **Region and State Representation**: Similar disparities were found at regional and state levels, with some areas like the Pacific region and California being significantly overrepresented.
- **Ecosystem Representation**: Terrestrial ecosystems dominated the research, while marine and freshwater ecosystems were significantly underrepresented.

## Limitations & Future Research

The study faced limitations, such as the non-random nature of the dataset and the inability to account for unpublished journal articles. To address these issues, future research could focus on:
- Investigating whether publishing companies tend to favor studies conducted in their own region.
- Analyzing whether journal articles with statistically significant results (p < 0.05) are more likely to be published.
- Implementing a random sampling strategy to ensure that the data is unbiased.
